<h3>Essential Information</h3>
<ul>
	<li>This site is being used as practice HTML/CSS and to document what APIs are for my understanding.</li>
	<li>I am using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXsD0ZgxjRw">this video from freecodeCamp's YouTube channel</a> as the source material for this site</li>
</ul>	
<h3>What are APIs?</h3>
<section class="whatareapis">
<article class="whatareapis1">
<p>API stands for Application Programming Interface:</p> 
<ul>
	<li>A - Application</li>
		<ul>
			<li> </li>
		</ul>
	<li>P - Programming</li>
		<ul>
			<li> </li>
		</ul>
	<li>I - Interface</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Providing the developer a means of controlling their interactions while hiding away all the complex and abstract stuff. We don't need to know <i>how</i> an API works, and the interface hides all of the complex and abstrct code from us (developers) so we don't "reinvent the wheel".</li> 
			<li>As a developer, we need to know what the API can do for us and how we can integrate it into our project.</li>
			<li>The interface defines ways for users to interact or communicate with an object (a GUI is a good example).</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
<p>APIs are essentially a set of instructions on how to interact with specific sites/apps/services. APIs are like a contract where they define how they will be used and defines what is expected to be received when being used. APIs are mostly 
web-based, but there are ones that are local.</p>
<p>Frameworks are API(s) that provide major customization and scalability to make it your own</p>
<p>Remote APIs are very good for the purpose of removing the limitation of computational power of a smartphone (for example).</p>

<article class="apiexamples">
<p>We use APIs every day to interact with a lot of different sources to obtain data. For example, the weather app on the iPhone uses an API to pull data from the Google weather services to leverage in their app.
Another example of an API is the Spotify app on your phone using an API to pull the song you want to listen to from their servers and stream it to your device. A third, and probably very common, example is YouTube. 
They use APIs to load the videos in the web browser and stream the videos from their servers.</p>

<article class="restvssoap">
<p>There are two types of major APIs: REST (often called RESTful) and SOAP. SOAP came before REST and was invented by Microsoft. There are benefits to both, but REST is used to develop over 70% of public APIs. 
Powerhouse companies like Google and Amazon use REST APIs in their technologies.<br>Here are the benefits to both SOAP and REST:</p>
<ul>
	<li>REST (Representational State Transfer)</li>
		<ul>
			<li>REST allows for a variety of data formats while SOAP only allows XML.</li>
			<li>REST uses lower bandwidth, making these APIs faster when connecticting to remote servers/services/etc.</li>
			<li>REST is designed to access data while SOAP is designed to perform operations through a standardized set of messaging patters.</li>
			<li>REST is considered easy to work with, and thanks to JSON, REST offers superior support for browser clients.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)</li>
		<ul>
			<li>SOAP's standard HTTP protocol makes it easier for it to operate across firewalls and proxys.</li>
			<li>SOAP supports WS-Security, which is invauluable when in need of data privacy and integrity.</li>
			<li>SOAP has builti-in retry logic that prevents the user from manually retrying the API call the first time it fails.</li>
			<li>SOAP has a standard set of rules, which means that the service and consumer don't necesarily have to have the same understanding of content and context.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

<h3>How the web works</h3>
<p>APIs rely on and use the already-established protocols and design of the web, so it's important to have a high level understanding of how the web, protocols, clients, and servers work together to make this thing called the internet happen.</p>
<p>On a computer is a web client, which is used to access the web. the web client is used to access a server which is identified by the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) put into the address bar at the top of the screen. The URL is broken down by a scheme: the protocol and the web/domain address. the HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) portion is a protocol that defines how data is used and defined. HTTP protocol will use that URL and the get action, which indicates that this HTTP call (the action of hitting enter into the web client when searching for a site) is purely receiving data and not sending data/making changes to the server. The server receives the request that was transferred from the web client. The server does whatever work it needs to do and sends back the expected web page. The most important part of the response from the server is the body, which consists of HTML. The browser renders the page. If a link is clicked in web page, then this whole "get" process is performed again. Between the clicks that activate the HTTP protocol, it sits in a stateless "state", meaning that after it receives a response, it's inactive, not looking for anything. This is to help save resources in the web client. There are more https verbs that define what the https call is doing, such as post. A good example would be submitting a form and posting that data from the form to the server.</p>

<article class="RESTful">
<h3>RESTful API</h3>
<p>APIs are often defined by their constraints. Here are the ones that are required to be met for an API to be considered RESTful:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Client-Server Architecture</li>
	<li>Statelessness</li>
	<li>Cacheability</li>
	<li>Layerd System</li>
	<li>Code on Demand</li>
	<li>Uniform Interface</li>
</ul>	
<p>A request, an HTTP Get request in this case, is requesting information about a <i>resource</i>, which is also called an object. Resources often describe anything that is built (in the context of a web browser). Everything that we want those resources to do can be expressed using the acronym CRUD:</p>
<ul>
	<li>C: Creating</li>
	<li>R: Reading</li>
	<li>U: Updating</li>
	<li>D: Deleting</li>
</ul>
<p>This lines up with the 4 kinds of HTTP verbs that are used for that API call:</p>
<ul>
	<li>GET: retrives resources</li>
	<li>POST: creates resources</li>
	<li>PUT: changes and/or replaces resources or collections</li>
	<li>DELETE: deleted resources</li>
</ul>

<p>According to <a href="https://cyberinsight.co/what-is-an-uri-vs-url/">this</a> article, there is a difference between URLs (Uniform Resource Locator) and URIs (Uniform Resource Identifier). URLs are a type of URI that is used to identify a web resource using a protocol/scheme (https://), the domain name(www.example.com), and the path to the resource on that web server (/index.html). A URI is used to identify a name or resource on the internet. While URL only identifies web resources, a URI can identify any kind of resource using a string of characters that identifies a name or resource on the internet. URIs can include things like web pages, images, videos, and more. A URI consists of two main things: the scheme and the specific identifier of the resource you're trying to reach.</p>
<p>In short, a URL identifies a specific type of resource while a URI can identify any kind of resource</p>
